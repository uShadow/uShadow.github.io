One recent trend in web design is using a large image and a few big-font words
in the front page. Bootstrap calls it a [jumbotron][bootstrap-jumbotron] or a
[cover page][bootstrap-cover-page]. The difference between a jumbotron and a
cover page is that a jumbotron only stretches across the width of a browser,
whereas a cover page stretches across both the width and the height. There are
also other names that are used to refer to the same design element, like a
masthead. I do like this kind of design, because it is simple and eye-catching.

Interestingly, all these names have their origin from the publishing and
advertising industry. A [jumbotron][jumbotron-wiki] actually refers to a large
display that is often used for advertisement. A masthead is the nameplate of a
publication on the front page. As for a cover page, we can think of the cover
page of a book. These elements are not new, and they have endured the test of
time as a tool to attract people's attention. So borrowing these elements in web
design is quite smart.

For a while, carousel as a web component was quite popular, but I'm never a fan of it.
I can never quite catch what exactly is the message conveyed with a fast moving
carousel. However, if the carousel moves slowly, users will probably miss the
remaining cards, and that defeats the purpose of a carousel. This
website ([http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/][carousel])
gives a really humorous yet direct expalnation of why carousels are bad. 

So the static image and words do not have the problem of a carousel. They
usually presents one simple message that users can grasp quickly. Below are a
few examples of websites I like that use such a design element:

* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Simple and colourful masthead explaining what it
  does.
* [Google Nexus phones](http://www.google.com/nexus/6/) - One product image and
  one marketing message ("More space to explore").
* [Google Glass](https://www.google.com/glass/start/) - A cover page style. When
  you scroll down the mouse wheel, it brings up the entire next page. This
  page-by-page view feels just like fipping through a broshure. It is common
  for a
  cover page to have a downward arrow at the bottom to allow users to scroll
  down quickly to the product details.

Next, I will explore the design trend for the product detail information after the front header matter...
